WGU C773 User Interface Design Project

The purpose of this project is to create a user interface for a dog training business. The user interface will be used by the business owner to track client information, pet information, and gain customer information to schedule consulting services.

As a student, I will be using this project to demonstrate my ability to create a user interface that is easy to use and meets the needs of the business owner. Taking the staheholders' needs into account, I will be creating a user interface that is easy to navigate and appealing to the eye. WGU provides a website that needs to be updated. It has broken links, missing images, and is not mobile-friendly. The website is also not ADA-compliant. The website needs to be updated to meet the needs of the business owner and the customers.

Pictures, videos, and color schemes were predetermined per the requirements of the project (Western Governors University, 2022).

The user interface was designed with several User Personas in mind. The personas are as follows:

All Site Visitors: landing on the home page are interested in an overview of what the company does. First-time visitors will often leave the site completely if the layout does not easily identify the information available on the site and link to its pages within the website. Users landing on the home page view the site using desktop and handheld devices.

Cat Owners: are looking to understand the feeding needs for their cat based on type of cat, age, diet, and other preferences. Many users use a desktop device for their research. They are interested in recommendations about the best foods to meet their cat’s health at any stage.

Dog Owners: are interested in the activity needs of their puppy throughout its lifetime. They are often viewing the website from a handheld device as they are working with their puppy. They want to understand how play can support the dog’s health and are interested in recommendations about pet toys that encourage physical activity.

Bird Owners: are interested in the relational needs of their bird to ensure proper well-being. These owners often view the site using desktop devices.

Fish Owners: are interested in fresh and saltwater testing and maintenance based on the type of fish they house in their aquarium. These owners often view the site using handheld devices.

Small-Animal Owners: are interested in learning about suitable housing for their pets. They research animal characteristics and products so they can make decisions about the environment in which to house their pet. These owners often view the site using handheld devices.

The website content is predetermined per the requirements of the project (Western Governors University, 2022)- as you would expect from a real-world project.
